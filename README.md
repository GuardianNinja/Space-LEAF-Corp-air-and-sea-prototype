# Jarvondis Guardian Network

A modular prototype for planetary sensing and stewardship using biomimetic ocean and atmospheric systems.

**Author:** Leif William Sogge  
**Ceremonial Stewardship:** Jarvondis University  
**Mission:** Planet-first sensing, cleanup, and collaborative learning.

This prototype includes:

- Ocean clam-lab drift simulation
- Atmospheric nano-swarm storm tracking
- Krystal-core satellite relay logic
- Citizen and scientist interfaces

All modules are safe, non-biological, and designed for educational and scientific use.
